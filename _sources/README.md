# Pedagogy with Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter Hub, and Jupyter Book

This is a short demonstration of the open source tools that 2i2c can deploy
for pedagogical use-cases. All of these tools are Jupyter projects, and were
developed in part by 2i2c team members over the past several years.

```{note}
This content is just for demonstration purposes. The packages / tools / 
environments / etc can all be customized as needed for other courses and
textbooks.
```


## Book content and website

Jupyter Books allow you to distribute collections of notebooks in a book-like website.
They also let you make connections to interactive computing infrastructure (like
JupyterHub and Binder).

* The repository for this book [is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/2i2c-org/utoronto-demo)
* The book content is taken from [the QuantEcon textbook](https://executablebooks.github.io/quantecon-example/docs/index.html).
* The book is built with [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org)

## Lab content

Labs are useful for providing students more hands-on experience, allowing them
to explore ideas, data, and code.

````{admonition} Launch the lab
:class: tip
Labs are frequently launched via syllabus links or buttons in the content,
such as the one below!

```{link-button} https://utoronto.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-sync?repo=https://github.com/2i2c-org/utoronto-demo&urlpath=tree/utoronto-demo/lab/01-The-Neighborhood-fa2019.ipynb

* Lab content is taken from [the DS Modules project](https://ds-modules.github.io/DS-Modules/) ([sociology module](https://github.com/ds-modules/SOC-130AC))

## Infrastructure information

* The production hub is at [utoronto.2i2c.cloud](https://utoronto.2i2c.cloud)
* The staging hub is at: [staging.utoronto.2i2c.cloud](https://staging.utoronto.2i2c.cloud)
* Deployment and environment information for the hub can be found [in this github repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-utoronto/tree/staging/deployments/demohub/image)
